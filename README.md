## Voyage Analytics: Integrating MLOps for Predictive and Recommender Systems in Travel

### Project Summary

The travel and tourism industry is evolving rapidly, with an increasing demand for personalized and data-driven experiences. Our project, "Voyage Analytics: Integrating MLOps for Predictive and Recommender Systems in Travel," leverages machine learning and modern MLOps practices to enhance travel decision-making and customer experiences. By integrating diverse datasets and deploying sophisticated models, we aim to provide actionable insights and scalable solutions for the travel industry.

### Datasets and Objectives

1. **Users Dataset**: Contains user identifiers, associated companies, names, gender, and age. This data helps understand user demographics and enables personalized recommendations.

2. **Flights Dataset**: Includes travel identifiers, user codes, flight origins and destinations, flight types, prices, durations, distances, agencies, and dates. Crucial for predicting flight prices and analyzing travel patterns.

3. **Hotels Dataset**: Provides information on travel identifiers, user codes, hotel names, locations, stay durations, daily rates, total costs, and booking dates. Supports developing recommendations for hotel stays and pricing predictions.

### Project Objectives

1. **Regression Model Development**: 
   - Build a regression model to predict flight prices based on the Flights dataset.
   - Perform feature selection, model training, and validation.
   - Analyze historical flight data to forecast future prices and assist travelers in making informed decisions.

2. **REST API for Regression Model**: 
   - Develop a REST API using Flask for real-time price predictions.
   - Enable users and travel agencies to access the flight price prediction model through a web interface.

3. **Containerization**: 
   - Package and deploy the flight price prediction model using Docker.
   - Ensure portability and consistency across various environments.

4. **Kubernetes for Scalability**: 
   - Use Kubernetes for model deployment management.
   - Provide scalability and efficient load handling.

5. **Automated Workflows with Apache Airflow**: 
   - Design and implement automated workflows using Apache Airflow.
   - Create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to manage data pipelines and orchestrate complex workflows.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**: 
   - Establish a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
   - Automate the deployment process, ensuring consistent and reliable updates.

### Technical Execution and Evaluation

- Focus on the accuracy of regression, classification, and recommendation models.
- Implement the REST API, Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Airflow, and Jenkins correctly.
- Use MLFlow for model tracking and performance monitoring.
- Develop a Streamlit web app for user interaction with the models.
- Emphasize code quality, organization, and documentation.
- Maintain a well-structured GitHub repository with meaningful commit messages and comprehensive README files.

### Outcome and Impact

This project aims to provide advanced tools for predictive analytics and personalized recommendations in the travel industry. By integrating MLOps practices, we offer scalable, automated solutions for managing travel data and deploying machine learning models. The final deliverables will enhance decision-making for travelers and travel companies, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
